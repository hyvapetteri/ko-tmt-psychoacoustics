classdef KnockoutTournament < TournamentInterface
    %KNOCKOUTTOURNAMENT A class for running a knockout-type tournament of 
    % n_teams, until K best teams have been found.
    %
    %   Winner of each "game" is decided by choosing the team that has
    %   won wins number of games. For example, in a best-of-three, the
    %   number of wins required is two, and for a single game, number
    %   of wins is one.
    %
    %   Note, that the resulting K teams are an unordered set; the
    %   first team on the list may very well not be the best.
    %
    %   The tournament is played in two phases: first as a regular
    %   knock-out tournament, and then after the first winner is found,
    %   the same tournament is replayed by replacing the winner by the
    %   next team in teams_leave_out. The logic here is, that the
    %   second-best team in the first phase of the tournament is one of the
    %   teams that lost to the winner, and by replaying the tournament
    %   without the winner, the second-best should win â€”- no matter whether
    %   they lost to the winner in the first game or the final. However, if
    %   the team replacing the original winner is better than the original
    %   second-best, then that team will win the replayed tournament. There
    %   will always be top_K - 2 teams in teams_leave_out. After the last
    %   team from teams_leave_out has played in the tournament, the last
    %   tournament will run by replacing the last winner by an infinitely
    %   poor team, i.e. that the first opponent of the last winner will win
    %   the first game always.

    properties
        tmt_algo % either 1 for treesort or 2 for replacement selection
        N % total number of teams in the tournament
        n_rounds % number of rounds in the tournament tree
        max_games % maximum number of games in total
        games_played % games played so far in total. Updated after each full round
        top_K % how many top teams to pick
        k % the current k out of top_K
        wins % n of wins required (e.g. best of 3 -> 2 wins)
        idxs % the list of teams in random order

        % team_pos gives the starting location of a team in the tournament.
        % For example team_pos(2) will give the round and game numbers
        % where team 2 is seeded. The first row of team_pos contains the
        % starting round of each team, and second row contains the index
        % of the team in tmt{round}
        team_pos

        % tmt is the tournament tree as a cell array, where each cell of
        % the array corresponds to a tournament round. Each tournament
        % round cell contains an array of team numbers, and adjacent teams
        % in the array are paired for comparison. There are always an even
        % number of teams in each round.
        tmt

        % res has the same structure as tmt, but instead of team numbers,
        % it contains the scores for each round.
        res
        teams_leave_out % teams left out of the first phase

        round % current round in tmt (-> tmt{round})
        game % current game in round

        replay % replay is true if we are not anymore in the first phase of the tournament
        preround % is there a pre-round for getting the number of games to 2^n?
        finished % has the tournament finished?
        n_round_games % number of games in the current round
        k_winners % the final top_K winners

        name = 'Knockout' % name of the round
